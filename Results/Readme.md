The MCM results are named according to the convention: 
* 'Temperature'-'filling scheme'-'r1'-'Plot generated'
The ACM results are named according to the convention:
* 'Number of temperature slices'-'Temperature of the results'-'filling scheme'-fn3='r3'-fn1=-'r1'-'Plot generated'

The names of the plots generated are shortened descriptions:
* ErrorMetrics = the error metrics of the SMSE, wSMSE, AARD, and wAARD for each rank tested
* Parity = Parity plot
* 2Hist = 2-way histogram - errors
* 3Hist = 3-way histogram - errors and ARDs
* Err-3way = error per prediction in a 3-way cubic plot
* UppervsLower = most accurate predictions from the Upper or Lower triangular arrays
* UNIFACvsMCM = most accurate predictions from the MCM or UNIFAC
* UNIFACvs3ACM =  most accurate predictions from the 3ACM or UNIFAC
* MCMvs3ACMvxUNIFAC = most accurate predictions from the MCM, 3ACM, or UNIFAC
* BAC = error metrics for each BAC group including the SMSE, wSMSE, AARD, and wAARD
* Func = error metrics for each combination of functional groups including the SMSE, wSMSE, AARD, and wAARD
* MixturesInterest = predictions for the mixtures of interest found in a set of results
* Mixtures = predictions of all mixtures that were observed in the array. LOOCV results
